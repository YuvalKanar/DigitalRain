## Main effect
First, letters are randomly generated on the x plane and pushed onto a vector.
Then, in each iteration, all of the letters are drawn on the canvas and their y axis value is decreased according to the letter gap.

## Rain effect
Add trailing mechanism in which during x iterations (may be random) following the first letter, letters appear above the previous letters.

## Changing effect
Each letter may change by chance:
  If random results in true:
    Change letter after random number of iterations
